            "description": "Occultists in Orrorsh and treacherous thralls in Tharkold make frequent use of this spell when dealing with the deadly demons of their cosms. To employ a protective circle, the caster draws a visible, one-meter-radius circle in chalk, blood, salt or other material, then embellishes in with arcane runes. Once drawn, and for as long as the caster maintains Concentration, supernatural beings may not cross the border. They may speak and otherwise interact across the border normally, but any supernatural powers (such as spells or special abilities) suffer a -2 penalty. If another force or being breaks the circle's drawn boundary the spell ends. Success Levels: *Good: The penalty is increased to -4. *Outstanding: The being's supernatural abilities cannot cross the boundary.",
